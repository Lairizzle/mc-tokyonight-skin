# Tokyo Night for Midnight Commander

A clean, modern Midnight Commander skin inspired by the [Tokyo Night Neovim theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) â€” perfect for fans of elegant dark UI with soft contrast and vibrant accents.

This theme brings full Tokyo Night aesthetics to your terminal file manager, blending seamlessly with terminals using the [Tokyo Night color palette](https://github.com/davidmathers/tokyo-night-kitty-theme), including Kitty, Alacritty, and WezTerm.
